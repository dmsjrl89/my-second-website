<h2>Yoga란 무엇인가</h2> (/ˈjoʊɡə/ (listen);[1] Sanskrit: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga" target="_blank" title="definition">योग</a>, lit. 'yoke' or 'union' pronounced [joːɡɐ]) is a group of <strong>physical, <u>mental</u
  >, and spiritual practices </strong
  >or disciplines which originated in ancient India and aim to control (yoke) and still the mind, 
  recognizing a detached witness-consciousness untouched 
  by the mind (Chitta) and 
  mundane suffering (Duḥkha). There is a wide variety of schools of yoga, 
  practices, and goals[2] in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism,[3][4][5] and traditional and modern yoga is practiced worldwide.[6]

  Two general theories exist on the origins of yoga. 
 <br> The linear model holds that yoga originated in the Vedic period, as reflected in the Vedic textual corpus, 
  <br>and influenced Buddhism; according to author Edward Fitzpatrick Crangle, this model is mainly supported by Hindu scholars. 
  According to the synthesis model, yoga is a synthesis of non-Vedic and Vedic elements; this model is favoured in Western scholarship.[7][8]
