<h2>Meditation</h2>
Meditation is a practice in which an individual uses a technique – 
such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity – 
to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.
<p>
Meditation is practiced in numerous religious traditions. The earliest records of meditation (dhyana) are found in the Upanishads, 
and meditation plays a salient role in the contemplative repertoire of Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism.[5] Since the 19th century, 
Asian meditative techniques have spread to other cultures where they have also found application in non-spiritual contexts, such as business and health.
