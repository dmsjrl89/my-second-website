<h2>importance of excercise</h2> 
Exercise is a body activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness.[1]

It is performed for various reasons, including weight loss or maintenance, to aid growth and improve strength,
develop muscles and the cardiovascular system, hone athletic skills, improve health,[2] or simply for enjoyment. 
Many individuals choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, socialize, and improve well-being as well as mental health.

In terms of health benefits, the amount of recommended exercise depends upon the goal, the type of exercise, and the age of the person. 
Even doing a small amount of exercise is healthier than doing none
